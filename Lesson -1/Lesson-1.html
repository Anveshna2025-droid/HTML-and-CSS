    <!--Before beginning , there 2 basic things that we need to have .They are: 
    1. A code editor( like vs code)
    2. A web browser (like google chrome)-->
    <!--what is HTML? HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.-->
   <button>Hello</button>
   <!-- we just created a button . <button> is start tag and </button> is end tag and in between is what will be displayed --> 
    <p>Paragraph of text</p>
    <!-- this is a paragraph tag . <p> is start tag and </p> is end tag and in between is what will be displayed-->
    <!-- to comment out everything, select it and press Ctrl+/ -->
    <a href="https://youtube.com">take me to youtube </a>
    <!-- this represents anchor element -->
     <!--href is a attribute that specifies the URL of the page to link to-->
     <!-- href is an attribute that modifies the behavior of the link -->
      <!-- sttribute specifies how an html element behaves -->
       <!-- a href , here a is the element and href is the attribute . and href ="" , here href is the attribute and "" is the value of the attribute --> 
        <br>
    <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank"> open youtube in new tab </a>
    <!-- target is also an attribute that specifies where to open the linked document -->
     <!-- blank is a value of the target attribute that opens the link in a new tab -->
     <!-- href and target attribute work on button and a tag only not on p tag  -->
      <!-- if you have multiple spaces between words it will be displayed as a single space in the browser because html ignores multiple spaces -->
       <!-- to add space between button and links we use br tag -->
